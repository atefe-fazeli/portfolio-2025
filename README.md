# Portfolio 2025

Welcome to **Portfolio 2025**, my personal front-end showcase built with modern web technologies.  
This project is designed to highlight my skills, growth, and the practical implementation of concepts I’m learning in real-time.

---

## 🌟 Overview

Portfolio 2025 is a dynamic and modular personal portfolio built using **React** and **Next.js**.  
It demonstrates:

- **Component-driven architecture & Design System**: All UI components are reusable, well-typed with **TypeScript**, and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.  
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & SEO optimization**: Fast page loads, reduced JS bundle size, and optimized search engine visibility.  
- **Interactive UI**: Smooth animations, lazy-loaded project cards, dark/light mode toggle, and detailed project pages.

The portfolio is not just a showcase—it’s also my **learning playground** for new front-end trends and best practices.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React** (Functional components, hooks)  
- **Next.js** (App router, SSR, dynamic routing)  
- **TypeScript** (Typed components, interfaces, generics)  
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling)  
- **Framer Motion** (Smooth animations)  
- **SEO & Metadata optimization** (Dynamic metadata per project page)

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Build a **scalable and modular front-end architecture**.  
2. Learn and demonstrate **advanced TypeScript concepts** in real projects.  
3. Optimize performance using **SSR and lazy loading** techniques.  
4. Share progress and learning experiences publicly to **engage with the dev community**.
